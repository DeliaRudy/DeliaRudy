## Hi there, I'm Ruvimbo Delia üëã

AI Engineer ‚Ä¢ Data & Business Analyst ‚Ä¢ Technical Writer 

ü§î**Disclaimer:** The repositories and contributions on this account represent personal projects and do not reflect my professional work contributions, which are primarily on privately hosted.

## About Me
I‚Äôm a trained Data Analyst and Cloud Architect with deep experience in FinTech, Health, and Sustainability. I‚Äôve spent years crafting end-to-end data entry pipelines and reporting functionalities that help group companies turn raw data into actionable insights. I am now working in a new role as an AI Engineer, focused on bridging AI capabilities with real-world business workflows. I am a curious being and that is what has driven my growth journey. I start learning based on fascination and complete the journey because of projects that I would have started. Those initial sparks of fascination often become the passion projects featured here.

üíº Currently building AI-powered analytics and RAG pipelines for enterprise reporting systems. I am also building a personal efficiency measurement project paired with a budgeting app. The goal? Tie my daily activities, historical work, and network referrals to real dollars and cents in my wallet.

üåê I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and giving back to the community, and I do so through community building and working within the start-up ecosystems programmes in both paid and voluntary positions. I volunteer as Google Developer Groups Harare Organizer and Google Women Techmakers Ambassador organizing events, hackathons, facilitating workshops and mentoring developers.
